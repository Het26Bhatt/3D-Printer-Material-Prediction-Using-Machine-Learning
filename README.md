# 3D-Printer-Material-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Project Description

3D printing efficiency hinges on identifying faults before they cause wasted materials and failed prints. This project addresses this challenge by developing a web application. The application leverages machine learning to analyze 3D printer movement data (X, Y, Z) and predict potential faults, ultimately saving time, materials, and revolutionizing 3D printing efficiency.
